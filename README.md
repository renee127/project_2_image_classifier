# project_2_image_classifier
AI Programming with Python Udacity course second project

## Description

This application trains a deep learning model on a [dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of different species of flowers. Once trained, predict.py predicts the flower name from an image along with the probability of that name.  
Then the trained model can be used to classify new images.
